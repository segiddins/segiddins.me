title: Hire Samuel Giddins
---

I'm Samuel Giddins. You probably know me as `segiddins` from the internet, or projects such as Realm, CocoaPods, Bundler, or RubyGems.

I'm graduating the University of Chicago this December, and that means I'm looking for a job. If you've ever wanted to hire a segiddins, this is your chance!

I'm open to doing almost anything -- I have experience working on all types of software -- given a healthy work environment, a diverse and welcoming team, and the chance to be engaged with my work. In the past, I've focused on building developer tools, frameworks, databases, package managers, new web formats, and compilers.

I'm willing to relocate, but positions that are open to (at least occasional) remote work would be ideal for me. I love to travel, and particularly to speak at conferences, and that won't stop after graduation.

I also love working on open source software in my free time, and that too will not stop in the foreseeable future.

If none of that is a deal-breaker for you, you think you're working on something interesting, and there's a good chance I'd fit in well on your team, please get in touch by emailing me, segiddins@segiddins.me.
