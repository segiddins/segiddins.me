Iâ€™m **Samuel Giddins**.

Currently, I'm the principal of Nerdsniped LLC, a software consultancy that specializes in doing whatever it is I'm good at.
Right now, that means maintaining [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).
Previously, I worked as a Staff Engineer at Abnormal Security, Cash App, and Square.
