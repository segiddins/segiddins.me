I’m __Samuel E. Giddins__. Right now, I’m working at [Realm](http://realm.io) as an iOS developer, building tools such as [CocoaPods](http:/cocoapods.org), [jazzy](https://github.com/Realm/jazzy), and [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit). I'm current on a year-long leave of absence from the University of Chicago, where I'm triple-majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I live in San Fransisco, but I'm a New Yorker at heart.
