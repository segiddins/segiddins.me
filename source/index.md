Iâ€™m __Samuel E. Giddins__.
Right now, I'm a second-year student in The College at the University of Chicago, where I'm double-majoring in Mathematics and Economics.
In my spare time, I work on the core teams of [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), [bundler](http://bundler.io), [jazzy](https://github.com/Realm/jazzy), and [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit).
Though I'm now living on the windy shores of Lake Michigan, I'm a New Yorker at heart, having done a detour through San Fransisco.
