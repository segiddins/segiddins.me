I’m __Samuel E. Giddins__. Right now, I’m working as a developer in New York City and a student at the wonderful University of Chicago. I’m working on a few projects at the moment, some of which I’m happy to share, and other that have to remain secret for a little while longer.

Over the past year, I’ve decided to pursue developing, and it quickly evolved into a passion. Nothing makes me happier than melding my love of interesting challenges with building awesome things that people get to interact with, making their lives better, easier, and more fun.
